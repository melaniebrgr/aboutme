			<h2>More about me</h2>
			<p>I like to create, particularly at the intersection of art, science, and technology. I started digital painting during a MSc in Chemistry, and during a subsequent MSc in Biomedical Communication I rediscovered web development. Things have gotten harder since GeoCities.</p> 
			<p>At present, I can be found at Imagineeringart during the week, where I illustrate science textbooks. On weekends I enjoy spending time with my boyfriend, Vince and my quadruped nephew, Pedro, and organizing events for the BMCAA. Sometimes I tweet, write, code pens, paint, and speak. I live in Toronto, Canada, home of Drake.</p>

				<blockquote>If you can identify the gaps between where the learner is now, and where they need to be, you can design for better learning experiences. Sometimes the gap is knowledge, but just as often it’s skill or motivation.</blockquote>

				<h3>Art Chantry Speaks: A Heretic’s History of 20th Century Graphic Design</h3>
				<footer class="author">- Art Chantry</footer>
				<blockquote>I’m in the business of fucking with people’s ideas and fantasies. It’s my job to use this language of graphic design to do so. I’ll use color and shape and line and form to make the viewer change their mind about something.</blockquote>
